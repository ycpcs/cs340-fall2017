Course Description
------------------

This course examines the semantics of programming languages. Topics include formal specifications of syntax, declarations, binding, allocation, data structures, data types, control structures, control and data flow; the implementation and execution of programs; and functional programming versus imperative programming. Other possible topics include non-procedural and logic programming; object-oriented programming; and program verification. Programming projects will provide experience in a number of computer languages.

Prerequisites
-------------

CS 201

Textbook
--------

Daniel Higginbotham, [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.nostarch.com/clojure), ISBN 978-1-59327-591-4.

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------

This class will cover some of the important concepts underlying computation and programming languages. We will also look at a variety of programming languages as case studies. One goal of the course is to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of different languages and programming paradigms for particular kinds of applications.

I expect that you start the course with a solid grasp of programming.

The course will consist primarily of lecture and discussion, with occasional in-class lab activities.

Two in-class midterm exams will be given. A scheduled final exam will be given; see the [Final Exam Schedule](http://www.ycp.edu/academics/final-exam-schedules/).

In-class quizzes may be given. Missed quizzes may not be made up.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1.   Use finite automata and regular expressions to define regular languages
2.   Use regular languages to define the lexical structure of programming languages
3.   Use context-free grammars context-free languages
4.   Use context-free languages to define programming language grammars
5.   Understand the essential semantic structures of programming languages (values, types, storage, control flow, etc.)
6.   Write nontrivial programs in "nontraditional" languages such as functional languages, logic programming languages, and prototype-based languages

### Grades

Grades are assigned on a 100-point scale:

> Numeric Range|Letter Grade
> -------------|------------
> 90-100|A (4.0)
> 85-90|B+ (3.5)
> 80-85|B (3.0)
> 75-80|C+ (2.5)
> 70-75|C (2.0)
> 60-70|D (1.0)
> 0-60|F (0.0)

Your overall grade for the course will be determined as follows:

-   Homework and programming assignments: 30%
-   Midterm exams: 40% (20% each)
-   Final exam: 20%
-   Attendance/participation: 10%

### Course website

Please check the course web page, <http://ycpcs.github.io/cs340-fall2017/>, regularly for important announcements.

### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments are posted in the Schedule on the course web page. I expect you to do the reading **before** class. When I give a lecture, I will assume you have done the reading. I encourage you to use class time to ask questions about parts of the reading you did not understand to your satisfaction.

### Homework assignments

You **must** make a legitimate attempt to complete every homework assignment. I reserve the right to fail any student who does not make a good faith effort to complete all of the homework assignments.

### Posting and submission of assignments and labs

Assignments and labs will be posted on the course web page, <http://ycpcs.github.io/cs340-fall2017/>.

Assignments will be submitted using the server <https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset>. You will receive an email containing the username and password you should use for this server.

### Academic Integrity

The following policy pertains to homework and graded (individual) programming assignments:

> Because the individual assignments are essential for working towards and demonstrating the achievement of the course outcomes, and outcome 6 in particular, you must solve them on your own.  You may discuss the problem and high-level (pseudo-code) approaches to solving the problem with other students.  You may *not*, under any circumstances, discuss or share concrete implementation techniques or code.  Examples of forbidden types of collaboration include, but are not limited to: looking at another student's code, allowing another student to see your code, viewing and/or using code from an external source such as a web page, discussing the use of specific API functions to solve a problem, giving or receiving help debugging specific code.

Exams must be completed individually.

Lab assignments are not graded&mdash;therefore, you may work with other students on them.

Any violation of the course's academic integrity policy will be referred to the Dean of Academic Affairs, and could have consequences ranging from a 0 on an assignment to dismissal from the college.

### Late Assignments

Late assignments will be marked down 10% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than two (2) days late.**

### Exams

No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided. All exams will be open book and open notes.

### Attendance and Participation

I expect you to attend class and participate regularly in class activities. If you miss a class, please notify me in advance. You are responsible for all material covered in class, regardless of whether or not you were present. If you attend and participate in class regularly, you can expect to receive full credit for attendance and participation. Frequent absence and/or lack of participation will reduce the credit you receive for attendance and participation. You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the course schedule.

### Disability accomodation

If you had an IEP or 504 plan in high school or if you have a disability or health condition that impacts you in the classroom, please contact Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, at 815-1785 or <lmille18@ycp.edu> to discuss obtaining the accommodations for which you may be eligible. If you already have an accommodation memo and wish to access your accommodations in this class, please see me confidentially to discuss.

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students' need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members' authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.
