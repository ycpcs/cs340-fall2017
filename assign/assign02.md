title: "Assignment 2: Finite automata"

**Due: Monday, Sep 18th** by 11:59 PM

Your Task
=========

Your task is to create finite automata for the regular languages described below.

For each of the following finite automata problems, use JFLAP to construct the automaton, saving it in a JFLAP file (which will have a **.jff** file extension). Please use the filenames **prob1.jff**, **prob2.jff**, etc.

The JFLAP jar file is here:

> [JFLAP.jar](../resources/JFLAP.jar)

You can start it from a terminal window with the command

    java -jar JFLAP.jar

If the problem asks for a deterministic finite automaton, make sure that your automaton does not have any nondeterministic states. (In JFLAP, use the **Test&rarr;Highlight Nondeterminism** menu option.)

**Important**: For all of your finite automata, make sure that each transition is labeled with either a *single* input symbol, or lambda (λ), which is how JFLAP denotes an epsilon transition (a transition that does not consume a symbol from the input string.) JFLAP allows transitions to consume multiple input symbols, but please do not use this feature.

Problem 1
---------

Construct a deterministic finite automaton that recognizes the language over the alphabet {a, b} containing all strings with an odd number of b's.

For example, the following strings are members of the language:

> b
>
> ab
>
> aba
>
> bbabaa

The following strings are not members of the language:

> ε
>
> abb
>
> bababb

Problem 2
---------

Construct a deterministic finite automaton that recognizes the language over the alphabet {a, b} containing all strings with an even number of a's and an odd number of b's.

For example, the following strings should be accepted by the automaton:

> b
>
> aab
>
> aba
>
> baa
>
> bbabaaa

The following strings should be rejected by the automaton:

> ε
>
> ab
>
> aabb
>
> abab

Problem 3
---------

Construct a finite automaton (deterministic or nondeterministic) that recognizes the language over the alphabet {a, b} generated by the regular expression:

> (a\|ab\|abb\|abbb)\*

For example, the following strings should be accepted by the automaton:

> ε
>
> a
>
> aa
>
> aab
>
> abba
>
> abbabbab

The following strings should be rejected by the automaton:

> ba
>
> abbbb

Problem 4
---------

Construct a finite automaton (deterministic or nondeterministic) that recognizes the language over the alphabet {a, b, c} of all strings not containing the substring ba.

For example, the following strings are members of the language:

> ε
>
> a
>
> ab
>
> bb
>
> bc
>
> cbc
>
> abbb

The following strings are not members of the language:

> ba
>
> baba
>
> aba
>
> ccaabac

Problem 5
---------

Construct a deterministic finite automaton that recognizes the language over the alphabet {a, b} of all strings where the number of a's in the string is a multiple of 3.

For example, the following strings should be accepted by the automaton:

> ε
>
> bb
>
> ababa
>
> aaba
>
> aaababaa

The following strings should be rejected by the automaton:

> a
>
> aba
>
> baaabaa

Submitting
==========

Create a zip file that has the JFLAP (.jff) files containing your automata for problems 1-5.

Submit the zip file to Marmoset as **assign02**. The Marmoset URL is
