# Getting started

Download [cs340-clojurequiz.zip](cs340-clojurequiz.zip).  It is an Eclipse project, so you can import it into Eclipse using **File&rarr;Import...&rarr;General&rarr;Existing projects into workspace&rarr;Archive file**.  You should see a project called **cs340-clojurequiz** in your Eclipse workspace.

# Your task

Complete the **swap-maybe**, **negate-all**, **rotate1**, and **rotaten** functions in `src/cs340_clojurequiz/core.clj`.  Each function is described by a detailed comment with example inputs and expected results.

You can test your functions by running the command `lein test` in a terminal window from the root of the project.

You can also start a Clojure REPL (in Eclipse) by right-clicking in `core.clj` and choosing **Clojure&rarr;Load file in REPL**.  This is very useful for testing your functions interactively.

<div class="callout"><b>Important</b>: make sure you follow the requirements for each function.</div>

## Resources you may use

You may use your textbook, the [course website](http://ycpcs.github.io/cs340-fall2016), the [Clojure MOOC](http://mooc.fi/courses/2014/clojure/) website, the [clojure.org](http://clojure.org/) website, and the [clojuredocs.org](http://clojuredocs.org/) website.

## Submitting

When you are done, make a zip file of the project (everything in the `cs340-clojurequiz` directory) and upload it to Marmoset as **clojurequiz**:
