  ; Source of data:
  ;  http://writeonly.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/adjacency-list-of-states-of-the-united-states-us/
  ; Note: I modified the data so that the Four Corners states aren't
  ; considered adjacent to their diagnoal neighbors.  The reason is
  ; that adjacency to the diagonal neighbors would make the graph
  ; non-planar, meaning that the feasibility of 4-coloring is not
  ; guaranteed.
