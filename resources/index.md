# JFLAP

Create and test finite automata and Turing Machines.

* Download: [JFLAP.jar](JFLAP.jar)
* Website: <http://jflap.org>

# RegexToolkit

Test regular expressions by checking strings and determing whether two regular expresisons are equivalent.

* Download: [regexToolkit.jar](regexToolkit.jar)
* Website: <https://github.com/daveho/RegexToolkit>

RegexToolkit is a slightly improved version of **regexChecker.jar** and **regexEquivalenceChecker.jar** from [Lab 1](../labs/lab01.html).

Run it as follows:

* To test whether strings are accepted or rejected by a regular expression, run the command

      java -jar regexToolkit.jar check

* To test whether two regular expressions are equivalent, run the command

      java -jar regexToolkit.jar equiv

# Clojure resources

* [ClojureDocs.org](http://www.clojuredocs.org/) has documentation and examples for the built-in Clojure functions
