# Your task

Implement merge sort in Clojure.  For example:

{% highlight clojure %}
(mergesort [62 88 32 51 58 4 57 10 82 90])
{% endhighlight %}

should yield the result

{% highlight clojure %}
[4 10 32 51 57 58 62 82 88 90]
{% endhighlight %}

Hints and requirements:

* Assume that the input sequence will be a vector
* Use the `subvec` function to split the input 
* The `mergesort` function does **not** need to be tail recursive: however, your merge function should be tail recursive
* The initial accumulator should be a vector, and the overall result should be a vector
* You are welcome to use the merge function from [Lecture 14](../lectures/lecture14.html), but note that you will need to adapt it to use `conj` rather than `cons`
