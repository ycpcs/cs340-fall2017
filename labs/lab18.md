title: "Lab 18: Clojure review 3"
---

# Getting started

Download [cs340-lab18.zip](cs340-lab18.zip).  It is an Eclipse project, so you can import it into Eclipse using **File&rarr;Import...&rarr;General&rarr;Existing projects into workspace&rarr;Archive file**.  You should see a project called **cs340-lab18** in your Eclipse workspace.

# Your task

This is a Clojure review lab.  It is intended to prepare you for Exam 2.

Complete the **rotate-triple**, **make-repeated-applicator**, **make-triple-rotator**, **make-pairs**, **count-nested**, and **my-eq** functions in `src/clojure_review3/core.clj`.  Each function is described by a detailed comment with example inputs and expected results.

You can test your functions by running the command `lein test` in a terminal window from the root of the project.

You can also start a Clojure REPL (in Eclipse) by right-clicking in `core.clj` and choosing **Clojure&rarr;Load file in REPL**.  This is very useful for testing your functions interactively.

<div class="callout"><b>Important</b>: make sure you follow the requirements for each function.</div>

## Resources you may use

You may use your textbook, the [course website](http://ycpcs.github.io/cs340-fall2014), the [Clojure MOOC](http://mooc.fi/courses/2014/clojure/) website, the [clojure.org](http://clojure.org/) website, and the [clojuredocs.org](http://clojuredocs.org/) website.

Note that this lab is not graded, but it is intended to be a (second) preview of Exam 2, so you should try to complete it using only the resources listed above (which you will also have access to for Exam 2.)

# Solutions

Here are my solutions: [lab18.clj](https://github.com/ycpcs/cs340-fall2016/blob/gh-pages/labs/lab18.clj).  **Do not look at these until you have completed all of the functions on your own.**
