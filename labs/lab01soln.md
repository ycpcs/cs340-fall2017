You can use `regexEquivalenceChecker.jar` to compare your answers to the following solutions.

Note that when you enter a regular expression using the equivalence checker, **e** means ɛ.  So, replace occurrences of "ɛ" in the regular expressions below with "e".

Language 1: abb(aa)\*

Language 2: (ab)\*(a&#124;ɛ)&#124;(ba)\*(b&#124;ɛ)

Language 3: a\*ba\*(a\*ba\*ba\*)\*
