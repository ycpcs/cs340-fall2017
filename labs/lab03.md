# Getting Started

This is a paper and pencil exercise.

# Your Task

Consider the following NFA (nondeterministic finite automaton):

<img style="margin-left: 40px; width: 40em;" src="img/lab03.svg" onerror="this.src='img/lab03.png'">

Convert this NFA to a DFA: a *deterministic* finite automaton.  Simulate the execution of the NFA by considering which *sets* of NFA states map to each DFA state.

As you encounter reachable states, make sure you immediately follow epsilon transitions (denoted above with Î») to find the *epsilon closure* of each reachable set of NFA states.  For example, even though q0 in the NFA is the start state, q1 is reachable from q0 by an epsilon transition, so NFA states {q0, q1} map to the DFA start state.

Your task is to produce:

* The table mapping NFA state sets to corresponding DFA states
* The resulting DFA (equivalent to the NFA)
